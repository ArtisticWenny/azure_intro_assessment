Exploring Microsoft Azure
## **1. Identify & List Services: Choose at least two distinct services under each category.**
### Storage: 

###### Azure Data Lake Storage

###### Azure Confidential Ledger 

### Computer:

###### Azure CycleCloud Documentation

###### SQL Server on Virtual Machine

### Database Services:

###### Azure SQL Database

###### Azure Cosmos Database 

## **2. Service Description: Write a brief description for each chosen service based on the official documentation.**

### Storage: 
  ##### Azure Data Lake Storage
###### Azure Data Lake Storage is a centralized repository that can store structured and unstructured data. This service provides easy access for the data of an organization in a single location. In Data Lake, data can be stored in its raw or native format (files or binary large objects).
##### Azure Confidential Ledger 
###### Azure Confidential Ledger (ACL) provides highly secure services for sensitive data records. ACL runs on hardware-backed secure enclaves, and ACL uses the Azure Confidential Computing platform and the Confidential Consortium Framework. ACL offers integrity advantages, immutability, tamper-proofing and append-only operations.
### Computer
##### Azure CycleCloud Documentation
###### Azure CycleCloud is a tool for managing High Performance Computing environments. CycleCloud can supply infrastructure for HPC systems, scale infrastructure to run jobs efficiently, and deploy HPC schedulers. 
##### SQL Server on Virtual Machine
###### SQL Server on Azure provides a full version of SQL Server in this cloud, with no need to manage any on-premise hardware.
### Database Services
##### Azure SQL Database
###### Azure SQL Database is a fully managed PaaS database engine that can upgrade, patch, backup and monitor without user involvement. Azure SQL can help create high-performance data storage layers for applications in Azure. This database allows the user to process relational data and non relational structures. 
##### Azure Cosmos Database 
###### Cosmos Database is a fully managed NOSQL and relational database for modern app development. Cosmos AB provides high speed response  times, automatic and instant scalability. Cosmos DB can be used for applications to achieve low latency and high availability. 

## **3. Python Interaction: Describe how you may or could interact with this service using Python. You don't need to write any code, but hint towards how Python could be used to leverage this service (e.g., through SDKs, APIs, etc.).**
###### I can use Python to create applications, and machine learning models and utilize Azure Data Lake Storage to store the data for the application. I can build applications for medical companies and use Azure Confidential Ledger to maintain the privacy and security of the data. I can also use the Azure SDK to import tools to transfer and store the data.
